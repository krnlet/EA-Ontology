Anticipatory Technology Ethics (ATE) and Assessing Expectations (AE) are approaches to assess 
the technologies as to ethics within research and development. The focus in these 
approach is foresight analysis where the analysis is about future products, uses, and impacts.
In ATE and AE is possible identify general ethical issues, also are useful for innovation
projects due to practical implementation of recommendations based on ethical assessments.

The ontology is composed for these two approaches in ethical assessments, to create a formal way 
that will help to expertises in ethics to get useful tools to use ethical assessments
<br>
Figure 1 provides a general overview of EA-Ontology. It is worth noting that some elements might be deleted and the model is not final as it is still ongoing work.</span>

EA-Ontology is basically divided in three parts: Technology, Ethical analysis and Expectation analysis, the two last are part to find ethica issues. 
Figure 2, shows only "Ethical analysis" part. In this part, there are three levels (Technology Level, Artefact Level and Application Level) and in each one there is analysis about features of technology, artefacts and applications is possible detect a foresight analysis, i.e. analysis of the future. For instance, in a Ethical analysis, we coud describe: Genetic engineering, involves the manipulation of DNA in cells and organisms. This is a defining feature of the technology. At the technology level, a generic ethical issue is whether such manipulation violates natural order or the dignity (Exmaple taken by Brey, 2012) of life.

Figure 3 is a general overview of Expectation analysis, in this part is important to explore all possible expectation made for the technology and in each one identify if is possible detect a ethical issue.

	This sections shows the use case made by Paul Kuyer (PhD Student and fellows of Protect project). The use case is about Adapatative learning system and he developed the Ethical assessment around expectations.Figure 4 provide a diagram with the information wrote above. 
</p>
<p>
	Next list shows the main concepts about the assessment:</p>
	<p><strong>Technology's name</strong> Adapatative learning system</p>
	<p><strong>Technology's technique</strong> Decision tree and prediagnostics</p>
	<p><strong>Technology's Features</strong> Sealf paced study</p>
	<p><strong>Expectations found</strong> Improvement student performance</p>
	<p><strong>Expectation's evidence</strong> Created on 2016 in a website</p>
	<p><strong>Expectation's source</strong> webpage</p>
	<p><strong>Technology Feasability</strong> Presupposes the feasability of modelling users and content effectively and match them accordingly</p>
	<p><strong>Social Usability</strong> While the experience can be empowering beacuse students face fewer exercises there are too challenging the positive effects of overcoming difficulties together are also mitigated by adapative learning system, as students no longer share common difficulties.</p>
	<p><strong>Desirability</strong> Our moral views could change in a way that will increasingly emphasize and value non-automatable task if this is correct then the desirability of adaptative learning systems will decrease instead of increase witg the advancements in technology development</p>
	<p><strong>Ethical issues</strong> Phychological harm</p>

	Example number 2 is about Machine Learning. Due to this a way to develop AI systems, was assesst with ATE methodology. Figure 5 shows the graphical example to assesst Machine Learning.
</p>
<p>
	Next list shows the main concepts about the assessment:</p>
	<p><strong>Technology's name</strong> Machine Learning</p>
	<p><strong>Technology's technique</strong> Based on statitics</p>
	<p><strong>Technology's Features</strong> Used for classification</p>
	<p><strong>Users</strong> Developers</p>
	<p><strong>Technology Level</strong> The algorithm favours a certain sex or race over 
another which may 
negatively affect the 
possibilities of already 
and marginalised people</p>
	<p><strong>Application Level</strong> Correlation between features 
of the input data can be 
difficult to understand or the 
algorithm exhibits a socalled 
uncertainty bias</p>
	<p><strong>Foresight analysis</strong> The type of algorithm
 that causes most 
ethical issues are 
neural networks</p>
	<p><strong>Issues Identification</strong> Specific characteristics 
that make them prone
 to bias and cause 
them to have an 
opaque character</p>
	<p><strong>Ethical Evaluation</strong> Machine learning is becoming 
increasingly popular due to 
several factor such as a noom 
in online data low computational 
costs and improvement in 
learning algorithms</p>
<p><strong>Negative implication</strong> Machine learning are able to 
detect certain patterns in data 
humans are not able to 
surpassing human_capabilities</p>
	<p><strong>Ethical issues</strong> Discrimination/Bias</p>
